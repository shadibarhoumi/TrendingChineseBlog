## Explanation

**钢不钢** | gáng bù gáng

(slang) a variant of “刚不刚” (gáng bù gáng), meaning “Is this awesome or what?” This slang term (which uses the 刚 gāng character but pronounces it with the second tone) comes from 东北话 (dōng běi huà), the much-loved Northeastern Chinese dialect whose funny expressions have a knack for trickling into mainstream usage. In the dialogue above, played with the slang by replacing the original “刚” with “钢” (gāng, “steel”) because the present he prepared is a stainless steel placard.

“刚” (gáng) in its slang usage is used to describe someone (usually male) who has a strong and straightforward personality.

For example, you can refer to your local loud, joking, assertive convenience store owner as “好刚一男的 (Hǎo gáng yīnán de), or “What a “gáng” guy.” When used with positive intention, it means the person is very upright and honest. When used in a negative intention, it carries a mocking tone, meaning that person is reckless, impulsive, and arrogant.

**钢铁大直男** | gāngtiě dà zhí nán

(slang) literally “big steel straight guy,” or “a guy who is straight as steel.” “直男” ( zhí nán, straight guy) has a special implication on Chinese social media. It’s used to refer to a classic straight guy who is awkward in conversation, unfashionable, unromantic, and basically doesn’t understand women at all.

Here’s a classic “钢铁大直男” move: you’re on a chilly outdoor date, your girlfriend tells you that she feels cold, and instead of giving her your jacket to wear, you stupidly say, “alright, let’s walk faster then.” Your author has personal experience with this one 😭.

## Part 2: The reveal.

真正的钢铁直男是没有礼物的。Zhēnzhèng de gāngtiě zhí nán shì méiyǒu lǐwù de.
Real "pure steel straight guys" don't even have a present.
